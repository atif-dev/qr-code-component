## My process

  - Use existing knowledge.
  - Explore CSS over Internet according to need.
  - Used Responsively desktop app for responsiveness of some screens.
  - Check responsiveness for following screens:
	  - [x] 375 * 812
	  - [x] 1280 * 950
	  - [x] 720 * 1280
	  - [x] 1366 * 768
	  - [x] 1440 * 900
	  - [x] 1920 * 1080
	  - [x] 1920 * 1200

### Continued development
